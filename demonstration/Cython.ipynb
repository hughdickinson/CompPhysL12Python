    "The ability to augment your analysis code using selected components of a **pre-existing** software framework is extremely useful. It is **not** typically the case that implementation of a computational scientific analysis requires the use an **entirely** novel numerical algorithms. Even if software that performs the intended analysis does not exist, it is likely that elements of one or more software frameworks can be **combined** to synthesize the required functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If **source code** written using the **same programming language** is available for the required software components, the most straightforward approach may entail **aggregating and compiling** the code that defines the required functionality. Having access to source code also enables implementation of **fine-grained modifications** to the numerical algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of providing the entire source code, many modern software frameworks are distributed using a combination of **shared libraries** and **header files**. If header files are provided that are **compatible** with the programming language that is being used to implement a scientific analysis, then the functionality provided by the framewor can be straightforwardly incorporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **functional components** of shared library files are simply **binary representations** of **machine-level instructions** for manipulating input data. In principle, these instructions can be executed in multiple contexts, provided that a suitable **interface description** is available. A language-compatible header file is an example of such an interface description but other options are possible.\n",

Header files that define interfaces with C linkage must typically be compiled using **_both_** **C** and **C++** compilers. The **`extern \"C\"`** token pair is **not** valid in the **C** language and the tokens that define the **`extern \"C\"`** code bock must be hidden from **C** compilers using **C Preprocessor conditional** structures that depend on the preprocessor macro **`__cplusplus`**. If the file is being processed by a **C++** compiler, then the **`__cplusplus`** macro will be **defined**. Otherwise **`__cplusplus`** will **not** be defined.
